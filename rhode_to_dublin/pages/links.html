                The designer and musician for this website is Timmy May. Timmy May
                learned web programming in the 1990's by using view-source on the NCSA Mosaic web browser
                and copying and editing html pages.
                This was an interesting time and allowed him to work for a number of successful and unsuccessful
                companies during the dot-com boom. Then in 2003 he became a family person and he returned to his original
                career as a high school math teacher. The current era of web programming is a bit more
                complicated. Mr. May found a talented student who knows many of the latest concepts and this student 
                created the current form of this website. I think student JC has a bright future as a computer
                programmer and I am thankful that he was willing to help me with an update of 
                the Rhode to Dublin website in June 2025.
